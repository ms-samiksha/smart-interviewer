# smart-interviewer
A web-based application that simulates a realistic, AI-powered mock interview experience with smart analysis, feedback, and progress tracking.

# Project Overview

The Smart AI Interviewer is designed to help users practice interviews in various domains (e.g., Data Science, Web Development, HR) with customizable difficulty levels and durations. It leverages AI to analyze tone, facial expressions, and response timing, providing detailed feedback and improvement tracking over time. The app records sessions, generates graphical summaries, and allows users to download or email their results.
